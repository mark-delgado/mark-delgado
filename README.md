- 👋 Hi, I’m @mark-delgado
- 👀 I’m interested in Meteorology and Climatology. Combine that with programming and you have an interesting combo.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the ins and outs of Python and Jupyter Notebook.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on well, not too much, this is mostly about work related things.
- 📫 How to reach me? maybe mark.bloodstar@gmail.com would be a good place to start.

Hopefully, I'll be able to rexplore and learn lots!
